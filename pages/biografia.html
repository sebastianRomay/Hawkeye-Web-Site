                <p>An expert marksman and fighter, Clint Barton puts his talents to good use by working for S.H.I.E.L.D. as
                    a special agent. The archer known as Hawkeye also boasts a strong moral compass that at times leads him
                    astray from his direct orders.</p>

                    <h2>Golden Archer</h2>
                    <p>Very little is known about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Hawkeye or his origins. An
                        accomplished combatant and weapons master, he was present for Thor’s arrival on Earth, and was
                        impressed with the God of Thunder. He was also instrumental in bringing over Natasha Romanoff,
                        AKA Black Widow, to the side of S.H.I.E.L.D, sparing her life and offering her a path to
                        redemption.For his extraordinary abilities, he was recruited by Nick Fury to be part of the
                        Avengers Initiative. Unfortunately, in his first mission with the Avengers, he initially worked
                        against them, thanks his mind being controlled by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief. After
                        being broken free, however, the horrified Clint did work alongside his fellow Super Heroes to
                        bring down the trickster god.Since then, he has managed to put his talents to good use against
                        the Chitauri, Ultron, HYDRA, and even his fellow Avengers when it seemed necessary.</p>

                    <h2>Sniper Mentality</h2>
                    <p>As one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s best agents, the World’s greatest marksman, and an Avenger, Hawkeye uses
                        traditional weapons as well as high-tech ones, with a strong affinity for his archery bows. Few
                        humans on the planet compare to Clint Barton when it comes to his astonishing talents in precise
                        marksmanship, fighting, flying, and tactical prowess.An expert acrobat, military-trained
                        combatant, and master assassin, Barton can stand toe-to-toe with some of the best fighters
                        around. He is also a master tactician and spy—the Avengers face quite a bit of difficulty when
                        Hawkeye works for Loki and turns his plans against them.Hawkeye’s specialized equipment include
                        recurve bows, compound bows, a specialized arrow quiver, speed loader, Busse dagger, a
                        S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued handgun, and collapsible baton.</p>

                    <h2>An Agent’s File</h2>
                    <p>S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clint Barton has kept his past and private life a secret, like any good spy.
                        Known only to his closest confidantes, he is married to Laura Barton and together, the couple
                        have three children, Cooper, Lila and Nathaniel. When not globe-trotting on missions, he lives
                        with his family on the homestead that Director Nick Fury helped establish for them in
                        secret.Dubbed Hawkeye, Barton has used his beyond expert-level marksman skills to remove
                        S.H.I.E.L.D.’s enemies from the board; however, he has been known to make his own moral judgment
                        calls in the field. In one case, Fury sent Barton to kill the Russian assassin codenamed Black
                        Widow. Instead, he offered to bring Natasha Romanoff over to their side and the two not only
                        became not only faithful allies, but also good friends.</p>
